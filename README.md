<h2> SCRUM Master for E-Learning Site Development </h2> 

<img width="350" align="left" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 104318" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9b91014-e474-4270-981b-71ad151c5990" />

I served as the Scrum Master and project lead for the development of the e-learning platform, overseeing the entire project lifecycle. I led cross-functional teams in building the website, producing video lessons, and creating downloadable learning materials such as e-books and PDFs, as well as managing the UX/UI design. I ensured timely sprint deliveries while maintaining high-quality standards and aligning the product with both educational goals and user experience objectives.

The website features 25 essential skills that every leader or entrepreneur needs to thrive in today‚Äôs competitive business landscape. Designed to drive excellence, these skills are organized around four core pillars: personal strategy, team strategy, performance strategy, and results-driven strategy‚Äîeach one aimed at empowering users to take decisive action and lead with clarity and confidence.

At the time of its launch, the platform didn‚Äôt just meet expectations‚Äîit exceeded them. The website achieved 100% of the KPIs established for the project and surpassed its initial registration goal by over 300%. This exceptional performance turned the project into a flagship success story, marking a major milestone in Abundiantia Training‚Äôs mission to develop high-impact leaders.

Originally launched in 2018, this e-learning project became a vital pillar for the company when the pandemic hit in 2020, allowing operations to continue despite the challenges. Not only did it go on to become one of Abundiantia Training‚Äôs greatest achievements, but it also remains one of the projects I‚Äôm most proud to have led and brought to life.

I designed and taught one of Platzi‚Äôs top-rated courses on OBS Studio, guiding students from beginner to advanced levels in live streaming and video production. As the course instructor, I developed a hands-on curriculum combining technical mastery with real-world broadcasting practices, making complex topics easy to understand and apply. My goal was to empower students not just to use OBS, but to think like professional streamers and content creators.

This project allowed me to leverage my skills in instructional design, UX/UI, audiovisual production, and agile content development. I led the end-to-end creation of the course, from scripting to publishing, ensuring an engaging and practical learning experience. With hundreds of 5-star reviews, students consistently highlight the course‚Äôs clarity, structure, and real-life applicability, and I‚Äôm proud to have helped so many creators build their confidence and skills in the streaming space.
